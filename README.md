# Omni SDK

Omni SDK is a JavaScript library to interact with HOT Bridge - a protocol for minting omni-assets within the HOT OMNI Balance smart contract.

See how HOT Bridge works [here](https://hot-labs.gitbook.io/hot-protocol/vqtWI3SVupbKsdCP1xgA/omni-tokens).

Omni SDK key features include:

- Connect NEAR, EVM (currently deposit only to Intent account binded to NEAR wallet)
- Deposit token widget (from NEAR, EVM)
- Withdraw token widget (to NEAR, EVM)
- Find pending withdrawals and finish them
- View HOT Bridge tokens balances on Intents.

Coming soon:

- Support for Solana, TON, and Stellar â€” connect, deposit, and withdraw.

## Install

The sdk requires `nodejs` version 20.18.0 or higher.

```bash
npm install @hot-labs/omni-sdk
```

---

## Initialize

To initialize the Omni SDK and interact with HotBridge from your frontend you should create a new instance of HotBridge class:

```js
import { mainnet, base, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, bsc, avalanche } from "viem/chains";
import { HotBridge } from "@hot-labs/omni-sdk";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useNearWallet } from "./near";

export const bridge = new HotBridge({
  evmRpc: {
    8453: base.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    42161: arbitrum.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    10: optimism.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    137: polygon.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    56: bsc.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    43114: avalanche.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    1: mainnet.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
  },

  executeNearTransaction: async () => {
    throw "executor not implemented";
  },
});

// Reach hooks to use the bridge instance
export const useBridge = () => {
  const nearWallet = useNearWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    bridge.executeNearTransaction = async (tx) => {
      const hash = await nearWallet.sendTransaction(tx);
      return { sender: nearWallet.accountId!, hash };
    };
  }, [nearWallet.accountId]);

  return { bridge };
};
```

Let's break down the code so we can understand what is happening.

### Instantiating the Bridge

We are instantiating a `HotBridge`, and defining a dictionary of `chain-id` to `rpc-url` mappings. This is later used by the bridger to ....

```js
export const bridge = new HotBridge({
  evmRpc: {
    8453: base.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    ...
    1: mainnet.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
  },

  executeNearTransaction: async () => { throw "..."; },
});
```

### The Hook

In order for other components to use the bridger, we are creating a react hook.

Notice that we are setting the `executeNearTransaction` function on the bridge instance. In our example, the function is in turn calling an instance of the `walletSelector` to sign and send the transaction on NEAR.

```js
// Reach hooks to use the bridge instance
export const useBridge = () => {
  const nearWallet = useNearWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    bridge.executeNearTransaction = async (tx) => {
      const hash = await nearWallet.sendTransaction(tx);
      return { sender: nearWallet.accountId!, hash };
    };
  }, [nearWallet.accountId]);

  return { bridge };
};
```

---

## Deposit

The `Hot Omni Bridge` deposits tokens directly into the [NEAR Intents](https://app.near-intents.org/) smart contract (`<address.near>`). This allows users to ....

### NEAR

Depositing tokens from NEAR requires calling `bridge.near.depositToken` method, and passing the following parameters:
- `getAddress`: function that returns user's NEAR accountId
- `getIntentAccount`: function that returns user's NEAR Intent accountId
- `sendTransaction`: function that sends a transaction on NEAR (see near react hook)
- `amount`: amount of tokens (without denomanation), e.g. 1000 for 0.001 USDT (usdt.tether-token.near)
- `token`: token contract, eg. usdt.tether-token.near 

```js
const nearSigner = useNearWallet();

// ...

const handleDeposit = async (e: any) => {
  // ...

  await bridge.near.depositToken({
    getAddress: async () => nearSigner.accountId!, // User's accountId
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!, // User's accountId on NEAR Intents (on NEAR it's the same as accountId)
    sendTransaction: nearSigner.sendTransaction, // method sendTransaction from to actually make a transaction on NEAR (see near react hook)
    amount: BigInt(amount), // Amount of tokens (without denomanation), e.g. 1000 for 0.001 USDT (usdt.tether-token.near)
    token: token, // Token contract, eg. usdt.tether-token.near
  });

  // ...
}
```

See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/DepositComponent.tsx#L46).

### EVM chains

Depositing tokens from an EVM chain requires using the `bridge.evm.deposit`. Similar to the NEAR deposit, you need to pass the following parameters:
- `getAddress`: function that returns user's EVM address
- `getIntentAccount`: function that returns user's NEAR Intent accountId
- `sendTransaction`: function that sends a transaction on EVM (see evm react hook)
- `amount`: amount of tokens (without denomanation)
- `chain`: chain id of the EVM chain
- `token`: token contract (e.g. ...)

```js
const evmSigner = useEvmWallet();

// ...

const handleDeposit = async (e: any) => {
  // ...

  const deposit = await bridge.evm.deposit({
    getAddress: async () => evmSigner.address!, // User's EVM address
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!, // User's NEAR Intent account
    sendTransaction: evmSigner.sendTransaction, // method sendTransaction to actually make a transaction on EVM (see evm react hook)
    amount: BigInt(amount),
    chain: network,
    token: token,
  });

  await bridge.finishDeposit(deposit);

  // ...
}
```

This method will make a deposit on a contract **in the corresponding EVM chain**, handling token approvals if necessary.

To let the NEAR Intents smart contract know that the deposit was made on a specific chain, we need to call the `bridge.finishDeposit` method.

The `bridge.finishDeposit` method will gather all the deposit data from the EVM chain, and sign a message for the HOT Bridge MPC service to inform it, and them confirm that the deposit was credited by checking the new HOT OMNI Balance smart contract.

See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/DepositComponent.tsx#L46).

## Withdraw

### NEAR

To withdraw tokens on NEAR network you need just to call `withdrawToken` method of Omni SDK. For NEAR chain that method just asks user to sign withdrawing intent message and calls withdrawing transaction directly on NEAR Intents.

```js
// ...
const nearSigner = useNearWallet();

// ...

const handleWithdraw = async () => {
  // ...

  const result = await bridge.withdrawToken({
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!,
    signIntent: async (intent: any) => await nearSigner.signIntent(intent),
    receiver: receiver.trim(),
    amount: BigInt(amount),
    chain: network,
    token: token,
  });
  
  // ...
}
```

See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/WithdrawComponent.tsx#L47).

### EVM chains

To withdraw on Evm chain you should also call `withdrawToken` method of Omni SDK. Under the hood the method:

1. Check if there is unfinished withdrawing process. User can have only one unfinished withdrawal process
2. Ask user to sign withdrawing intent message and calls withdrawing transaction for HOT Omni Token on NEAR Intents to Hot Balance smart contract
3. Checks if withdrawal was created and has not been claimed yet
4. Signs withdrawal data using HOT Bridge MPC service.

But to finish withrawing you need to call additionally `bridge.evm.withdraw` method. That method withdraws funds from corresponding locker contract.

```js
const handleWithdraw = async () => {
  // ...

  await bridge.evm.withdraw({ sendTransaction: evmSigner.sendTransaction, ...result });

  // ...
}
```

See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/WithdrawComponent.tsx#L47).

## Swap

At the moment Omni SDK doesn't support exchanging functionality. To swap one token to another it's recommended to use [Near Intents](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/intents/swap) directly.
