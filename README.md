# Omni SDK

Omni SDK is a JavaScript library to interact with HOT Bridge - a protocol for minting omni-assets within the HOT OMNI Balance smart contract.

See how HOT Bridge works [here](https://hot-labs.gitbook.io/hot-protocol/vqtWI3SVupbKsdCP1xgA/omni-tokens).

Omni SDK key features include:

- Deposit tokens (from NEAR and EVM using NEAR Intents)
- Withdraw tokens (to NEAR and EVM using NEAR Intents)
- Handle pending withdrawals
- View HOT Bridge token balances (using NEAR Intents)

Coming soon:

- Support for Solana, TON, and Stellar â€” connect, deposit, and withdraw.

## Install

The sdk requires `nodejs` version 20.18.0 or higher.

```bash
npm install @hot-labs/omni-sdk
```

---

## Initialize

To initialize the Omni SDK and interact with HotBridge from your frontend, create a new instance of the HotBridge class:

```js
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { mainnet, base, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, bsc, avalanche } from "viem/chains";
import { HotBridge } from "@hot-labs/omni-sdk";
import { useNearWallet } from "./near";

export const bridge = new HotBridge({
  evmRpc: {
    8453: base.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    42161: arbitrum.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    10: optimism.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    137: polygon.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    56: bsc.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    43114: avalanche.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    1: mainnet.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
  },

  executeNearTransaction: async () => {
    throw "executor not implemented";
  },
});

// React hook to use the bridge instance
export const useBridge = () => {
  const nearWallet = useNearWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    bridge.executeNearTransaction = async (tx) => {
      const hash = await nearWallet.sendTransaction(tx);
      return { sender: nearWallet.accountId!, hash };
    };
  }, [nearWallet.accountId]);

  return { bridge };
};
```

Let's break down the code so we can understand what is happening.

### Instantiating the Bridge

We are instantiating a `HotBridge`, and defining a dictionary of `chain-id` to `rpc-url` mappings. This is later used by the bridge to interact with different chains.

```js
export const bridge = new HotBridge({
  evmRpc: {
    8453: base.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
    ...
    1: mainnet.rpcUrls.default.http as any,
  },

  executeNearTransaction: async () => { throw "..."; },
});
```

### The Hook

In order for other components to use the bridge, we are creating a react hook.

Notice that we are setting the `executeNearTransaction` function on the bridge instance. In our example, the function is in turn calling an instance of the `walletSelector` to sign and send the transaction on NEAR.

```js
// Reach hooks to use the bridge instance
export const useBridge = () => {
  const nearWallet = useNearWallet();

  useEffect(() => {
    bridge.executeNearTransaction = async (tx) => {
      const hash = await nearWallet.sendTransaction(tx);
      return { sender: nearWallet.accountId!, hash };
    };
  }, [nearWallet.accountId]);

  return { bridge };
};
```

## Hot Omni Tokens representations on Near Intents

### NEAR

When user deposits tokens from NEAR chains to Hot Bridge the user's balance is replenished with tokens of the format `nep141:wrap.near`.

### Other chains

For deposits from non-NEAR chains the user's balance on Near Intents is replenished with tokens which have format like `nep245:v2_1.omni.hot.tg:1111_3twhsFNJUtm8vS2g3NH1LVdQbwcYo4FaypDmUcwdSfuR1fd`. Here we have:
- `nep245:v2_1.omni.hot.tg:` is the prefix pointing that token is related to Hot Bridge
- `1111` - chain id within Hot Bridge
- `3twhsFNJUtm8vS2g3NH1LVdQbwcYo4FaypDmUcwdSfuR1fd` is the base58 encoded token address.

---

## Deposit

The Omni SDK allows users smoothly deposit tokens from different chains into the [NEAR Intents](https://app.near-intents.org/) smart contract (`intents.near`) on NEAR.

### NEAR

Depositing tokens process from NEAR interacts directly with `intents.near` smart contract.

It requires calling `bridge.near.depositToken` method, and passing the following parameters:
- `getAddress`: function that returns user's NEAR accountId
- `getIntentAccount`: function that returns user's NEAR Intent accountId
- `sendTransaction`: function that sends a transaction on NEAR (see [the near react hook](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/hooks/near.ts#L82))
- `amount`: amount of tokens (without denomanation), e.g. 1000 for 0.001 USDT (usdt.tether-token.near)
- `token`: token contract, eg. `usdt.tether-token.near`.

```js
const nearSigner = useNearWallet();

// ...

const handleDeposit = async (e: any) => {
  // ...

  await bridge.near.depositToken({
    getAddress: async () => nearSigner.accountId!,
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!,
    sendTransaction: nearSigner.sendTransaction,
    amount: BigInt(amount),
    token: token,
  });

  // ...
}
```

>_See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/DepositComponent.tsx#L46)._

### EVM chains

Depositing tokens process from EVM chains includes depositing assets into corresponding Locker contract, attestating that deposit transaction is executed successfully by signing it via Hot Bridge MPC service, and letting know Omni contract on NEAR that deposit was made.

Depositing tokens from an EVM chain requires using the `bridge.evm.deposit`. Similar to the NEAR deposit, you need to pass the following parameters:
- `getAddress`: function that returns user's EVM address
- `getIntentAccount`: function that returns user's NEAR Intent accountId
- `sendTransaction`: function that sends a transaction on EVM (see the [evm react hook](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/hooks/evm.ts#L55))
- `amount`: amount of tokens (without denomanation)
- `chain`: chain id of the EVM chain
- `token`: token contract (e.g. `0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48`)

```js
const evmSigner = useEvmWallet();

// ...

const handleDeposit = async (e: any) => {
  // ...

  const deposit = await bridge.evm.deposit({
    getAddress: async () => evmSigner.address!,
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!,
    sendTransaction: evmSigner.sendTransaction,
    amount: BigInt(amount),
    chain: network,
    token: token,
  });

  await bridge.finishDeposit(deposit);

  // ...
}
```

This method will make a deposit on a contract **in the corresponding EVM chain**, handling token approvals if necessary.

To let the NEAR Intents smart contract know that the deposit was made on a specific chain, we need to call the `bridge.finishDeposit` method.

The `bridge.finishDeposit` method will gather all the deposit data from the EVM chain, and sign a message for the HOT Bridge MPC service to inform it, and them confirm that the deposit was credited by checking the new HOT OMNI Balance smart contract.

## Withdraw

### NEAR

To withdraw tokens on NEAR network you need just to call `withdrawToken` method of Omni SDK. For NEAR chain that method just asks user to sign withdrawing intent message and calls withdrawing transaction directly on NEAR Intents. It requires passing the following parameters:

- `getIntentAccount`: function that returns user's NEAR Intent accountId
- `signIntent`: function that leverages Wallet Selector's signMessage method to sign intent's payload (see [the near react hook](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/hooks/near.ts#L60))
- `receiver`: a wallet address to withdraw assets to
- `amount`: amount of tokens (without denomanation), e.g. 1000 for 0.001 USDT (usdt.tether-token.near)
- `chain`: chain id
- `token`: token contract, eg. `usdt.tether-token.near`.

```js
// ...
const nearSigner = useNearWallet();

// ...

const handleWithdraw = async () => {
  // ...

  const result = await bridge.withdrawToken({
    getIntentAccount: async () => nearSigner.intentAccount!,
    signIntent: async (intent: any) => await nearSigner.signIntent(intent),
    receiver: receiver.trim(),
    amount: BigInt(amount),
    chain: network,
    token: token,
  });
  
  // ...
}
```

>_See the full code [here](https://github.com/hot-dao/omni-sdk/blob/main/demo-ui/src/components/WithdrawComponent.tsx#L47)._

### EVM chains

To withdraw on Evm chain you should also call `withdrawToken` method of Omni SDK and pass the same parameters as for NEAR chain. Under the hood the method:

1. Check if there is unfinished withdrawing process. User can have only one unfinished withdrawal process
2. Ask user to sign withdrawing intent message and calls withdrawing transaction for HOT Omni Token representaion on NEAR Intents to Hot Balance smart contract
3. Checks if withdrawal was created and has not been claimed yet
4. Signs withdrawal data using HOT Bridge MPC service.

But to finish withrawing you need to call additionally `bridge.evm.withdraw` method. That method withdraws funds from corresponding locker contract.

```js
const handleWithdraw = async () => {
  // ...

  await bridge.evm.withdraw({ sendTransaction: evmSigner.sendTransaction, ...result });

  // ...
}
```

## Swap

At the moment Omni SDK doesn't support exchanging functionality. To swap one token to another it's recommended to use [Near Intents](https://docs.near.org/tutorials/intents/swap) directly.
